A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\n  A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual.
